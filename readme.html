                **A00 - Comparing Languages**

This is a sample write up for the A00_LanguageComparison assignment.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


Submission
-----------


Create a zip file that contains all of your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).

Use folders to divide up the subparts of your submission.
For example, your zip file could look like the following:

~~~~
readme.html

    primepartitions.adb
    screenshot.png
go/
    primepartitions.go
    screenshot.png
haskell/
    primepartitions.hs

prolog/
    primepartitions.pl

python/
    primepartitions.py

Prime Partitions
=================

42 has 15 prime partitions, and they are...

Assignment Reflection
======================

<!--
How do the languages compare to one another?
Which language was your favorite?  Which was your least favorite?
What type of problems would each language be good at solving?
When you had a choice of language, why did you decide on the language in which you implemented your solution?
If you worked with a partnor, how did you decide to split up the work?

List any other comments below.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

The languages are quite different from each other, at least the two that I worked on (Haskell and Prolog).

I really liked Haskell and I think I would like Prolog as well if I get to know them better.

Prolog is good at solving problems related to symbols and logical relationships. It is not so strong at 

Haskell still seems like an art to be than a tool, but I really like it.

Ada is probably good at high performance and precision softwares since it has a very rigorous type checking system.

I did not have time to look into the rest, but I assume they are not very different from the C-family languages.

To be completely honest, I am not a big fan of this kind of I-don't-care-how-you-did-it-but-just-get-it-working problems, because when I don't know the language well, and don't have enough time to learn them in depth, I actually have to find a shortcut by spending time learning how to use some anti-patterns and abuse some of the language features in ways they are not designed to do. Even though the code is working, I do not think it demonstrates much understanding of the language itself, assuming they are simply "translations" from the original python code. I would rather spend those time learning the design and features.

But it's just my personal opinion...
